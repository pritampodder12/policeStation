# PoliceStation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.

## Development server
---------------------------------------------------

STEP 0:--   In your terminal run "git clone https://github.com/pritampodder12/policeStation.git". 
            After that change directory to the project folder which is "policeStation" by default.

STEP 1:--   RUN "npm install" to install all dependencies.


STEP 2:--   RUN "npm start" to run the project.


Wait sometime after running npm start. It will first run the node server
then it will run and automatically open the angular project in Google Chrome.

I have also attached some screen shot of this project.
